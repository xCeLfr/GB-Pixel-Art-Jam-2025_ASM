As I often say, to create a game, you need programmers and graphic designers.

I'm an average programmer and not a graphic designer at all, but I still try to create games.

So, what can I do at this PixelArt Jam? :)

Accepting criticism from others is very good for the ego.

So, I submit my humble participation in this jam; I did my best.

Proudly made without AI to generate any part of this project .
